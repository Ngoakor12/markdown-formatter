# Markdown-formatter
A tool for writing repeatative stand up reports faster without needing to manually add markdown as you type or after you type. It's different because you set your preferred styling on words or phrases your repeat only once. The next time you use it you just type your report and copy and paste into your markdown enabled chat tool (e.g. rocketchat)
